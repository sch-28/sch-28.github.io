# My portfolio

A little website, listing all my projects. Visit https://sch-28.github.io/

## Developing

```bash
npm run install && npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the portfolio:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy the website to a different host, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
